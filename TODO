**High Priority**

1. **~~Enhanced Output Formatting:~~**
    * ~~Implement a table view for process list and details.~~
    * ~~Consider adding color coding for visual differentiation.~~

2. **~~User Interaction Enhancements:~~**
    * ~~Implement basic filtering and sorting capabilities (name, PID, memory, CPU time).~~

**Medium Priority**

1. **Additional Features:**
    * Add an interactive mode with basic actions (kill, suspend/resume).
    * Implement a more advanced search mechanism (fuzzy matching, regex).

2. **Performance Optimizations:**
    * Consider lazy loading of process details and caching for improved performance.

**Low Priority**

1. **Further Enhancements**
   * Visualize the process tree (parent-child relationships).
   * Extend to monitor other system resources (disk I/O, network, GPU).
   * Implement alerts and notifications for resource usage thresholds.

2. **Cross-Platform Support:**
   * Create an abstraction layer for platform-specific code.
   * Implement backends for other operating systems.

**Rationale for Prioritization**

* **High Priority:** These enhancements directly improve the usability and readability of the tool, making it more user-friendly and effective for its core purpose.
* **Medium Priority:** These features add significant functionality and flexibility, making the tool more powerful and versatile.
* **Low Priority:**  These are valuable additions but can be considered later as they might involve more complex implementation or are less critical for the core functionality of the tool.

Remember that this prioritization is just a suggestion, and you can adjust it based on your specific goals and user needs.
